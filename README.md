| Visits | 2,500 | 5,202 |
| Payments | 15 | 39 |
| Overall CR | 0.6% | 0.75% |
| Payment CR | 6% | 9.4% |

## 🌐 Traffic Channel Analysis

| Channel | Visits | Registrations | Payments | Registration CR | Payment CR |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Instagram | 1,200 | 108 | 13 | 9% | 12% |
| TikTok | 1,800 | 126 | 10 | 7% | 7.9% |

| **Total** | 5,202 | 413 | 39 | 8% | 9.4% |

### Insights

- **Temu Ads** → Main traffic & volume driver
- **TikTok** → High traffic, low conversion (needs targeting optimization)

---

## 📊 KPI Summary

- CR improved after promotion
- ARPU decreased due to lower price
- LTV > CAC → Business model remains sustainable
- Funnel efficiency improved but payment stage still limits growth

---

## 🚨 Identified Bottlenecks

### 1️⃣ Registration → Payment Drop-off

Main issues:

- High initial price (before discount)
- Complex checkout UX
- Input errors during data entry
- Low trust in payments/delivery
- No abandoned cart triggers

---

## 💡 Hypotheses & Proposed Solutions

| Bottleneck | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Checkout complexity | Simplify form, add "Buy in 1 Click" |
| Payment hesitation | Add trust badges, reviews, guarantees |
| Abandoned carts | Trigger emails / chatbot reminders |
| Low AOV | Upselling & bundle offers |
| Weak retargeting | Paid retargeting on Instagram & TikTok |

---

## 📊 Visual Insights

After promotion:

- Traffic doubled
- Sales increased 2.6x
- Payment CR improved
- Total profit increased despite lower AOV

Instagram = Quality  
Temu = Scale  
TikTok = Optimization potential  

---

## 🎯 Final Conclusions

- Promotion significantly increased traffic and payments.
- The main conversion loss occurs at the **registration → payment** stage.
- The business model is economically sustainable (LTV > CAC).
- Further growth depends on:
  - Checkout UX optimization
  - Trigger-based marketing
  - Retargeting campaigns
  - Trust-building mechanisms
